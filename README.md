Welcome to the StoryClime Science Education App
=========================

## Version 3 of the StoryClime application

StoryClime uses Glitch, RaspberryPi, and APIs 
to build an educational application to teach children 
about space, science, and the world around them.

It was designed by Dan O'Brien, in part fulfillment of
a Higher Diploma in Computer Science at WIT.


### StoryClime

StoryClime teaches children about the science that underpins our world by making them the protagonists of their own adventures stories. The StoryClime app uses information inputted by you, the parent (first name, age, name of teddy), and data taken from a range of sources (such as NASA Mars Insight Weather Station, and the OpenWeatherApp), to create unique adventures for your child, narrated by their own imaginary friend.
The StoryClime app is completely free for all Earthbound users. 

For parents that want to really push the limits of their child's imagination, StoryClime provides a complete learning suite, spanning both online applications and real world interactive objects. These premium Moonbound members will receive the StarClimber1, a model space shuttle that will teach your child about their environment (temperature, pressure, and humidity) and the wonders of flight (pitch, yaw, and roll), through real time data displayed in the cockpit section of their StoryClime dashboard.

### Tools, Technologies and Equipment
To prototype the StoryClime app, I will use the web application builder Glitch. The app will be written with JavaScript. I will use APIs to gather information from sources such as the NASA Mars Weather Station. I will employ a Raspberry Pi and a Sense Hat to gather the data from the StarClimber1 space shuttle model. This information will be relayed to the StoryClime app through Google Firebase. The Raspberry Pi will operate using Python. The shuttle prototype itself will be fashioned from an oasis, which is lightweight and malleable.
